Planet Defense is a retro style 2D side view space shooter developed as a simple and clean java project. Its intended purpose is to produce a simple, yet 
satisfying and challenging reaction based video game, with the target audience of ages 6-18. The program features a 2-axial control plane for the player craft.
It also includes randomly generated enemies that provide the challenge the player must overcome. At regular intervals, boss monsters will spawn, very powerful compared to the regular aliens, sporting big health pools.
